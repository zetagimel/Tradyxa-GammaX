How to use Volume Profile for NIFTY trading 🧵

Most traders ignore this. Here's my 5-step method:

1/ Volume Profile shows WHERE most trading happened
2/ High volume zones = strong support/resistance
3/ If price is ABOVE the high volume zone = bullish
4/ If price is BELOW = bearish
5/ I built a free tool that shows this automatically
